# Stuga Dashboard Add-on

A mobile-first, Scandinavian-minimal Home Assistant dashboard.

## Access

After installation, access Stuga directly at:

```
http://homeassistant.local:3001
```

Or use your Home Assistant's IP address:

```
http://<your-ha-ip>:3001
```

**Note:** The sidebar link currently opens a blank page due to ingress path limitations. Use the direct URL above for full functionality.

## Configuration

No configuration required. Stuga automatically connects to Home Assistant using the Supervisor API.
